A man was hit by a cab in the street. 
He was brought to the hospital. 
His wife who was standing up by his bed, said to the doctor: "I think that he is very ill."
"I am afraid that he is dead." said the doctor.
Hearing this, the man moved his head and said: "I'm not dead. I'm still alive."
"Be quiet, " said the wife. "the doctor knows better than you!"

"Doctor," she said loudly, bouncing into the room, 
"I want you to say frankly what's wrong with me."
He surveyed her from head to foot. 
"Madam," he said at length, "I've just three things to tell you. 
First, your weight wants reducing by nearly fifty pounds. 
Second, your beauty could be improved if you used about one tenth as much rouge and lipstick. 
And third, I'm an artist---the doctor lives downstairs."

"May I borrow your record player tonight?"
